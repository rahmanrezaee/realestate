# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/img/logo.png
   - assets/img/logo-larg.png
   - assets/img/logo-med.png
   - assets/img/logo-small.png
   - assets/img/background1.jpg
   - assets/img/placehoder.png
   - assets/img/Vault.png
   - assets/img/mapMarker.png
  
   - assets/email.png
   - assets/error.png
   - assets/google_logo.png
   - assets/sucesso.png
   - assets/user_default_img_white.png
    # - assets/images/credit_cards.png
   - assets/logo_app.png
   - assets/img/svg/wc.svg



  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: "Vazir"
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Vazir.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Vazir-Light.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Vazir-Thin.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Vazir-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
